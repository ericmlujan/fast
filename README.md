Flying Apple Space Technologies
====

This is the main GitHub repository for Flying Apple Space Technologies.
We specialize in high-altitude ballooning and scientific research software.

### Projects

We have the following folders uploaded to this repository currently and actively maintain them:

* `blip-ruby`, a balloon launch and landing predictor written in the Ruby programming language.
* `blip-c`, a port of the original `blip-ruby` code into ANSI C.
* `liftbot`, a balloon lift and neutral buoyancy calculator.
* `bp`, a program for calculating the membrane pressure (backpressure) of a latex weather balloon, written in C specifically for Mac OS X, but portable to any UNIX-like system.
* `liftbot-gui`, a Java GUI version of the liftbot for Ruby packaged as an executable JAR file.
* `mathematica`, a collection of helpful notebooks we have created for Wolfram _Mathematica_.
* `matlab`, a mirror of the helpful backpressure matlab files from zmatt.net.

### Team

This repository is currently maintained by Eric Lujan (lujane@unlv.nevada.edu) and Jake Lee.
We are research assistants at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. 
We work with the awesome Amanda Maxham, Ph.D to do research, publish our results, and write these applications.
